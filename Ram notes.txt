To get advantages of using HRAM you should declare your variables like:
SFR AT(0xFD) my_HRAM_var;
[7:05 AM]
or else there will be no difference with any other

SVBK_REG = Bank num

Example uint8_t AT(0xD000) myvar;

To place something in an SRAM bank, you'd have to manually manage the bank and declare the variable something like:
uint8_t _at(some address in WRAM) my_wram_array[some size];
